As a general rule of thumb, it is best to keep your privacy settings as restrictive as possible. 

There is a delicate balance to manage with the amount of risk you want to take versus how engaged you want to be online. 

The only real privacy controls you have are self-regulated; Facebook or other social media sites wonâ€™t do it for you.

A bad actor can and will use your social media as a reconnaissance tool to build a 'target profile'. 

For example, this program took information that you have on your Facebook page and generated the list of passwords below.

********************************************************
*** IMPORTANT ***IMPORTANT ***IMPORTANT ***IMPORTANT ***
********************************************************
If you use any of the passwords listed below, it is highly recommended you change it immediately.
There are automated programs that can take your username and test it against all of these passwords.
This is far more efficient than "brute forcing" it (guessing every possible combination of password).

The current Facebook password requirements are:
    At least one character from the following character types: 
        Lowercase characters (a-z)
        Uppercase characters (A-Z)
        Digits               (0-9)
        Special scharacters  (0-9)

Length:
8-20 characters long

On a standard keyboard, there are 42 symbols/digits, 26 lower case letters, and 26 upper case letters. 
The total number of unique characters that can be used is 94. 
If a 10-character password is used, then the total number of possible unique passwords is...
53 QUINTILLION.

If an attacker tested one billion password combinations PER SECOND...
It would take over 1,700 years to get through all possible combinations.
