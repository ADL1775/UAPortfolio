These are examples of my C programming ability from the class: 
CSCV352 - Systems Programming

Each file has the associated .c and header files necessary for them to run.
Each program was made in Visual Studio Code in Kali Linux.

Each program also comes with a makefile to make compiling easier with GDB:
	Type "make" into your console to compile.
	Type "make clean" to clear the object files and executables.

Folders that have a .txt document, aside from the "Simple Game"
can have that .txt document piped into the program for manipulation.

Example: "./10_3 words.txt"

You will receive an error if a .txt file was required but not given.
