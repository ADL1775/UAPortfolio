These are examples of my ASMx86 programming ability from the classes: 

CYBV471 - Assembly Programming for Security Professionals

and

CYBV311 Intro to Security Programming II

The CYBV471 folder has the executables necessary to run the associated program.
The executables are prepended with "E". (Example: ELab14)
These programs were made using Visual Studio Code in Kali Linux.


The CYBV311 Folder has examples that were made using Visual Studio in a windows environment
and each program has an associated .c file.
